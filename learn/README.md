* [record_structures.sql](./record_structures.sql): Record structures and the report writer section  The purpose of this program is to learn about using record structures, populating them and the report writer section  Dosage Calculator audit information is stored in the database as an XML string. The string is extractable but not normally parse-able  The goal is to look for all pharmacy orders beyond a certain date using a query, then populating the record structure temp_1 with the order_id and dose_calc_xml  Then, we loop through the orders list in the record structure to use the cnvtxmltorec() function. This creates a new record structure each time called DosageInformation. We can then use that record structure that is created to populate final_dose and calculated_dose back to temp_1  Finally, the temp_1 contents are written out into a report and displayed in a spreadsheet view
